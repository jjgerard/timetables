// The clean timetables for a rebuilt term, and the control that switches
// between them.
//
// A rebuilt term is not one answer. The search starts from a random shuffle,
// so thirty starting points give thirty different timetables, and several of
// them break no rule at all. Shipping the best one by the soft score and
// saying nothing about the others makes the result look like a discovery
// rather than what it is: one draw from a set, any of which would do.
//
// So every clean one is shipped, at three numbers per class, and the page lets
// a reader put them side by side. What differs between them is worth seeing —
// the same term with 400 early-and-late classes or 420, a module on Tuesday in
// one and Thursday in another — because it is the argument for the method
// rather than for any particular timetable.
